> **Your landlord kept your deposit. Your mom got a medical bill that makes no sense. You got laid off on a Tuesday. Someone you love died, and no one handed you the checklist.**
>
> Generic AI is a very confident intern. **PM Skills** is the senior colleague's notes — 1170 of them, one markdown file each, for the moments at work *and* in life where "it depends" is not an answer. *(PM stands for Professional, not just Product Management. Yes, we get asked.)*

<!-- AEO Answer Capsule — 68 words -->
PM Skills is an open-source library of 1170 Agent Skills — plain-markdown SKILL.md files that teach an AI assistant to do one professional task to a senior professional's standard, from writing a PRD to decoding a lease or running a blameless postmortem. Each skill bundles the framework, an output template, quality checks, and anti-patterns. It is MIT-licensed and works with Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Cursor, and Codex.

## 🚪 Pick a door — 30 seconds each

| | You… | Do this |
|---|---|---|
| ▶ | **just want to see it** | open the **[Playground](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/)** and run a skill in your browser. No install, no signup, no "enter your email to continue" |
| 🧠 | **use Claude Code** | `/plugin` → search **pm-skills** → install. Ask *"decode this lease"* and watch |
| 🛠 | **use anything else** | `npx pm-claude-skills add` and pick your tool (Cursor, Codex, Windsurf, ChatGPT, Gemini…) |
| 🔎 | **don't know what to ask for** | type it at **[find](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/find.html)** — *"my landlord kept my deposit"* — and it names the skill |
| 🎒 | **are in the middle of something** | start from your moment, not the catalogue → **[Skill Packs](PACKS.md)** · 🍼 new parent · 💼 laid off · 🌍 new country · 👵 caring for a parent · 🕊️ losing someone · 💸 money in crisis |

**Nothing here can scare your setup.** A skill is a markdown file your AI reads. No runtime, no telemetry, no accounts. Installing copies text files; uninstalling is deleting them. Skeptical? Good instinct — [read one first](skills/lease-decoder/SKILL.md), it's written for humans too.

## 🥊 Without a skill vs. with one

| You say | Generic AI | With the skill |
|---|---|---|
| *"help me with my lease"* | 600 words on the importance of reading leases carefully | 🔴 **clause 14 auto-renews you into a full year** · 🟡 deposit terms written to fail · the two sentences to send back — [lease-decoder](skills/lease-decoder/SKILL.md) |
| *"write the PRD"* | a template with `[insert goal here]` in it | problem, users, requirements, metrics, the open questions — scored 0–40 against its own rubric before you see it — [prd-template](skills/prd-template/SKILL.md) |
| *"should we ship Friday?"* | "There are several factors to consider…" | `ship 0.18 · ship_reduced 0.71 · slip 0.11` — and the one fact that would flip it — [ship-or-slip](skills/ship-or-slip/SKILL.md) |
| *"practice my salary negotiation"* | "Great question! Confidence is key." | a hiring manager who pushes back, then an out-of-character debrief on what you gave away — [salary-negotiation](skills/salary-negotiation/SKILL.md) |

## ♻️ New: promote what you keep asking for

You have five prompts you type every week with small changes. Each one is a skill that hasn't been written down yet. The **[pm-skill-promoter](plugins/pm-skill-promoter/)** bundle closes the loop: scan your own transcripts, pick a pattern, draft the skill, test its triggers, publish it. One command: `/promote ~/.claude/projects/my-project`.

Here is the loop on the fixture in [`examples/promoter/`](examples/promoter/), a made-up three-week transcript with a few secrets planted in it:

```
$ python3 skills/promoter-scan/scripts/promoter_scan.py examples/promoter

| # | Pattern                            | Times | Score |
|---|------------------------------------|------:|------:|
| 1 | write release notes log            |    14 |    82 |   ← you asked for this FOURTEEN times
| 2 | draft update notes stakeholder     |     6 |    71 |
| 3 | summarise thread decisions owners  |     5 |    60 |

  "my api key is [api-key] please use it"      ← the planted secrets come out redacted
  "email the report to [email] and cc [phone]"
```

Pattern 1 becomes [`release-notes-from-git-log`](examples/promoter/drafted-skill/SKILL.md): a trigger built from the phrases you actually typed, three worked examples with your product name removed, and the corrections you kept making ("shorter", "group by feature", "user-facing tone") turned into quality checks. Then the test:

```
$ python3 skills/promoter-test/scripts/promoter_test.py drafted-skill/SKILL.md drafted-skill/evals.json
precision 1.0  recall 1.0        ← fires on "changelog entry from these commits", stays quiet on "write a haiku about deploys"
```

Then [`promoter-publish`](skills/promoter-publish/SKILL.md) prints the entire release package and asks once before pushing. The whole story, with every file: **[docs/PROMOTE-LOOP.md](docs/PROMOTE-LOOP.md)**. Nothing leaves your machine during the scan; the redaction runs before anything is written.

## 🎯 New: the decision layer

<p align="center">
  <a href="docs/JEV-DECISION-LAYER.md"><picture><source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="web/docs-assets/decision-layer.svg"><source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="web/docs-assets/decision-layer-light.svg"><img src="web/docs-assets/decision-layer.svg" width="100%" alt="The decision layer: a prompt goes in, a calibrated decision model picks the pack then the skill with probabilities, the skill runs, the artifact comes out — and the same typed questions guard inputs, gate journeys and judge evals" /></picture></a>
</p>

Some questions deserve a **number, not a paragraph**: *which of 1170 skills?* · *is this input safe?* · *escalate or hold?* · *does this output clear the bar?* The library now answers those with typed questions — defined options in, one answer with a probability per option out — served by [TypeSafe Jev](https://docs.typesafe.ai) where you have access, and by a labelled Claude-backed adapter where you don't. Every piece falls back honestly; nothing breaks without a key. **[The full map, all 20 pieces →](docs/JEV-DECISION-LAYER.md)**

```bash
npm run route -- "my landlord kept my deposit"
# security-deposit-recovery · pack pm-renters · tier high-stakes · confidence 0.83 · also: lease-decoder
```

| | |
|---|---|
| **Route** | a Claude Code [hook](hooks/suggest-skill-jev.sh) · `POST /route` on the [worker](mcp-remote/) · the [`pm-skills-jev-picker`](integrations/jev/) npm package · the **[Skill Router](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/router.html)** page: paste your week's prompts, see the skills you should have used |
| **Guard** | [input guard](integrations/jev/guard.mjs) on the free runs · [crisis router](integrations/jev/crisis.mjs) for public bots · [risk-tier second opinion](scripts/classify-risk-tiers.mjs) · [human-review queue](docs/HUMAN-REVIEW-QUEUE.md) ranked by harm |
| **Judge** | a [typed eval judge](evals/jev-judge.mjs) · [sycophancy scan](skillbench/SYCOPHANCY.md) · [route-bench](skillbench/reports/route-bench.md): keyword floor 50.9% top-1 on 271 cases, the Claude adapter 62.4%, the Jev row waiting on a credential |
| **Decide** | **[pm-decisions](plugins/pm-decisions/)** — [ship-or-slip](skills/ship-or-slip/SKILL.md) · [escalate-or-hold](skills/escalate-or-hold/SKILL.md) · [renew-or-churn-call](skills/renew-or-churn-call/SKILL.md) · [hire-or-pass](skills/hire-or-pass/SKILL.md): a state schema, defined options, thresholds, and a probability per option. A person still owns the call; the distribution is evidence |

No skill depends on a vendor. The SKILL.md files describe *contracts* any model can serve; the adapters live in [`integrations/jev/`](integrations/jev/), and a CI gate keeps it that way.

## 💬 What can I ask it to do?

Say it in your own words. The description does the routing:

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| 🏠 *"decode this lease before I sign"* → [lease-decoder](skills/lease-decoder/SKILL.md) | 📋 *"write the PRD for our referral feature"* → [prd-template](skills/prd-template/SKILL.md) | 🚨 *"blameless postmortem for Friday's outage"* → [incident-postmortem](skills/incident-postmortem/SKILL.md) |
| 💰 *"practice my salary negotiation"* → [salary-negotiation](skills/salary-negotiation/SKILL.md) | 📉 *"why is churn up this quarter?"* → [churn-analysis](skills/churn-analysis/SKILL.md) | ⚖️ *"rank the backlog with RICE"* → [rice-prioritisation](skills/rice-prioritisation/SKILL.md) |
| 🛂 *"prep me for the visa interview"* → [the-visa-interview](skills/the-visa-interview/SKILL.md) | 🔨 *"is this contractor quote fair?"* → [home-contractor-quote-decoder](skills/home-contractor-quote-decoder/SKILL.md) | 🏡 *"should we rent or buy?"* → [rent-vs-buy](skills/rent-vs-buy/SKILL.md) |
| 📝 *"draft my self-review honestly"* → [performance-review](skills/performance-review/SKILL.md) | 🚢 *"ship Friday or slip a week?"* → [ship-or-slip](skills/ship-or-slip/SKILL.md) | ♻️ *"what do I keep asking you for?"* → [promoter-scan](skills/promoter-scan/SKILL.md) |

…all 1170 live in **[the catalog](SKILLS.md)**.

## ⚡ Quick start

| You want to… | Do this |
|---|---|
| **Browse** | **[SKILLS.md](SKILLS.md)** · the [searchable web catalog](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/catalog.html) |
| **Install in Claude Code** | `/plugin` → search **pm-skills** *(official Anthropic directory)* — or `npx pm-claude-skills add --agent claude` |
| **Install in Cursor / Codex / Windsurf / Cline…** | `npx pm-claude-skills add --agent cursor` *(or `codex`, `windsurf`, `aider`, `cline`, `zed`…)* |
| **Use one skill in ChatGPT / Gemini** | copy from [`exports/chatgpt/`](exports/chatgpt/) or [`exports/gemini/`](exports/gemini/) and paste as instructions |
| **Skills over MCP, in any session** | `claude mcp add pm-skills -- npx -y pm-claude-skills-mcp` |
| **Route a prompt to a skill** | `npm run route -- "board meeting on Thursday"` |

No `npm install` needed — `npx pm-claude-skills …` always runs the latest. Per-tool instructions: **[docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md)**.

## 📚 The skills

Every skill follows the same discipline: what it produces, the inputs it needs, a real framework (severity scales, decision rules, not vibes), a concrete output template, quality checks, and anti-patterns. All 1170 pass the [SkillSpec](SKILLSPEC.md) L3 gate and a security audit in CI.

### Meta

Before installing *anyone's* skills (including these): [skill-vetting](skills/skill-vetting/SKILL.md) — a security read for SKILL.md files. The library's own standard lives in [SKILLSPEC.md](SKILLSPEC.md); every skill's level is enforced in CI.

### 💭 [pm-thinking](plugins/pm-thinking/) — think better
For when the model is *too* correct and gives you the average answer:
- [the-third-answer](skills/the-third-answer/SKILL.md) — skip the obvious, find the idea worth having
- [five-minds](skills/five-minds/SKILL.md) — one question, five clashing minds, then converge

### 🎯 [pm-focus](plugins/pm-focus/) — get unstuck
ADHD-friendly executive function, useful for every brain:

- [task-to-first-step](skills/task-to-first-step/SKILL.md) — beat activation-energy paralysis

## 🔍 What does a skill look like?

<!-- AEO Answer Capsule — 62 words -->
A skill is a single markdown file with a name, a description that tells the assistant when to activate it, and a body containing the working framework: required inputs, decision rules or severity scales, a concrete output template, quality checks, and anti-patterns. The assistant reads it and gains the judgment; humans can read, audit, and edit the same file. No runtime, no lock-in.
<!-- End AEO Capsule -->

```markdown
---
name: lease-decoder
description: "Decode a residential lease into plain English and rank the
  clauses that can hurt you. Use when someone asks 'what am I signing'…"
---
## Framework: Severity Scale
- 🔴 Can cost you real money — auto-renewal into a full new term, break
  penalties beyond re-rental costs, deposit conditions written to fail…
```

That's the whole trick. It's markdown. Your agent reads it and gains the judgment; you can audit it, edit it, or [write your own](SKILL-AUTHORING-STANDARD.md).

## ✅ Quality, not just quantity

| | |
|---|---|
| **Structure** | every skill passes the [SkillSpec](SKILLSPEC.md) L3 gate — framework, quality checks, anti-patterns — on every commit |
| **Evidence** | [eval-scored](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/leaderboard.html): 208 outputs, avg 4.8/5, judged blind. The [benchmark report](skillbench/REPORT.md) publishes the negative findings too |
| **Trust** | [risk tiers](docs/RISK-TIERS.md) on every skill · an [expert-review program](docs/EXPERT-REVIEW-PROGRAM.md) with a harm-ranked [queue](docs/HUMAN-REVIEW-QUEUE.md) · a [vendor-neutrality gate](docs/vendor-requests.md) · a security audit in CI |
| **Honesty** | decoders end with a not-advice line, calculators name what they don't model, simulators debrief out of character, and skills that shouldn't ghostwrite (your kid's college essay) coach instead |

<summary><b>Lint your own skills in CI</b></summary>

```yaml
- uses: mohitagw15856/pm-claude-skills@v79
  with:
    path: .claude/skills   # optional — it finds them otherwise
```

Checks frontmatter, the `Use when …` trigger clause a model actually matches on, leftover template text, and structure — and annotates each finding inline on the PR diff. Also `npx pm-claude-skills skillcheck`. Zero dependencies, no model call.

**Companion tools** for the bits a skill shouldn't guess — both MIT, zero-dependency, no model call: **[notugly](https://github.com/mohitagw15856/notugly)** (contrast and design-system checks the design skills call instead of estimating) and **[rulebook](https://github.com/mohitagw15856/rulebook)** (37 games, 203 rulings, for the board-game skills).

## 🆕 Latest

**[v80.0.0](https://github.com/mohitagw15856/pm-claude-skills/releases/latest)** — the promote loop: scan your transcripts for what you keep asking, draft it as a skill, test the triggers, publish. v79 added the decision layer. Everything else is in the **[changelog](CHANGELOG.md)**.

## ❓ Straight answers

<details><summary><b>Is it actually free?</b></summary>
Yes — MIT, all 1170 skills, forever. The skills are markdown; there is nothing to gate. Sponsors fund the playground's free model runs, not access.
</details>
<details><summary><b>Do I need an API key?</b></summary>
Not to browse, read, install, or use skills inside a tool you already have. The playground serves a few sponsor-funded free runs a day. A key only matters for optional extras: running skills from CI, or the typed decision layer (which falls back to keyword routing without one).
</details>
<details><summary><b>The catalog says 1170 but the folder has more. Which is it?</b></summary>
Both. There are <b>1178</b> directories under <code>skills/</code>; <b>12</b> of them are <a href="docs/DEPRECATION.md">deprecated</a> (marked in their frontmatter, each pointing at the skill that replaced it). They stay on disk so an old install command or a bookmarked name never breaks, and they are hidden from the catalog, the playground and the headline count. 1170 is what a person can browse; 1178 is what an installer can resolve.
</details>
<details><summary><b>I'm not a product manager. Is this for me?</b></summary>
PM stands for <i>Professional</i> here. Most of the library is decoders for leases and medical bills, salary-negotiation practice, career-moment kits, life admin, and 35 professions from teaching to veterinary. The product-management corner is just where it started.
</details>
<details><summary><b>Will this mess with my existing setup?</b></summary>
No. Skills are inert text files in a folder; your assistant reads them when relevant. Remove the folder and it's like they were never there.
</details>
<details><summary><b>How do I know these are any good?</b></summary>
Every skill passes a structural gate (SkillSpec L3) and a security scan in CI; 208 outputs are <a href="https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/leaderboard.html">eval-scored in the open</a> (avg 4.8/5), and the <a href="skillbench/REPORT.md">benchmark report</a> publishes the negative findings too. When something is machine-translated or unscored, it's labelled.
