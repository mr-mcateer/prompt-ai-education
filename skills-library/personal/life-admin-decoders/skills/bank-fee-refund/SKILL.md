description: "Get a bank fee waived or refunded — overdraft, late, maintenance, ATM, or foreign-transaction — with the ask written and the leverage that works. Use when asked to get a bank fee refunded, waive my overdraft fee, the bank charged me a fee, or how to get charges reversed. Produces a read on which fees are commonly reversible, the script to request a refund (in person, chat, or call), the loyalty/first-time/error leverage to use, and how to prevent the fee recurring — plus when to escalate or switch banks."

# Bank Fee Refund

Banks reverse fees far more often than people realize — especially for good customers who simply ask. A single overdraft or late fee is usually waivable with a polite, specific request and a little leverage. This tells you which fees are worth contesting, writes the ask, and sets up the account so it doesn't keep happening.

## What This Skill Produces

- **A reversibility read** — which fee this is and how commonly it's waived (one-off overdraft/late fees: often; some charges: rarely)
- **The request** — a short, specific script for chat, phone, or in person asking for a refund
- **Your leverage** — first-time courtesy, length/value as a customer, a genuine error, or a one-off slip
- **Prevention** — the setting or habit that stops it recurring (alerts, buffer, autopay, fee-free account)
- **Escalation** — what to do if refused, and when switching to a fee-free bank is the real fix

## Required Inputs

Ask for these if not provided:
- **The fee** — type (overdraft, late, monthly maintenance, ATM, foreign transaction), amount, when
- **Why it happened** — a slip, a bank error, or a recurring pattern
- **Your history** — how long with the bank, usually in good standing, first time or repeat
- **Channel** — do you prefer chat, phone, or branch
- **Goal** — just this refund, or stop it happening again

## Framework: Ask Well, Prove You're Worth Keeping

1. **Know which fees waive easily.** First-time or occasional overdraft, late, and maintenance fees are frequently reversed as goodwill; contest confidently.
2. **Ask specifically and politely.** "I noticed a $35 overdraft fee on [date] — I've been a customer [X years] and this is a one-off; could you waive it as a courtesy?" beats a vague complaint.
3. **Use real leverage.** First-time courtesy, loyalty/value, or a genuine bank error are the levers that work; if it *was* an error, say so plainly.
4. **Fix the cause.** Refund is step one; set up balance alerts, a small buffer, autopay, or move to a no-fee account so it doesn't recur.
5. **Escalate or leave.** Politely ask for a supervisor if refused once; if fees are chronic, a fee-free bank is the permanent solution.

## Output Format

### Fee refund: [fee type] · [amount] · [date] · customer [X yrs]

**Reversible?** [commonly / sometimes / rarely] — because [type].
**Leverage:** [first-time courtesy / loyalty / bank error / one-off].

**The ask** ([chat/phone/branch])
> [Notice the specific fee + date + amount, loyalty, one-off, request a courtesy waiver.]

**If refused:** ask for a supervisor once → [escalate / consider a fee-free account].
**Prevent recurrence:** [alerts / buffer / autopay / switch account].

## Quality Checks
- [ ] Identifies how reversible the specific fee type is
- [ ] Provides a polite, specific refund script
- [ ] Uses real leverage (first-time, loyalty, or error)
- [ ] Includes a prevention step so it doesn't recur
- [ ] Gives an escalation/switch path if refused

## Anti-Patterns
- **Assuming fees are non-negotiable** and never asking.
- **A vague angry complaint** instead of a specific, polite ask.
- **Being rude to the agent** who can choose to help.
- **Getting the refund but not fixing the cause.**
- **Tolerating chronic fees** instead of switching banks.

## Example Trigger Phrases
- "The bank hit me with a $35 overdraft fee — how do I get it refunded?"
- "Can I get a late fee waived? First time it's happened."
- "They charged me a monthly maintenance fee I didn't know about."
- "Write me a message to ask the bank to reverse a charge."
- "I keep getting overdraft fees — how do I stop them for good?"
