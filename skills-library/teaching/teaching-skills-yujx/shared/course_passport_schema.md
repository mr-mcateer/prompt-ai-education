# Course Passport (Schema 1)

The Course Passport is the single source of truth that travels through the entire teaching
pipeline. Every skill reads it; every stage appends to it; no skill silently mutates what
another stage wrote. It is the teaching-side analog of a research project's data ledger:
if a claim about the course isn't in the passport, downstream skills must not assume it.

Stored as `course_passport.yaml` in the working directory (or a path the professor chooses
at Stage 0). All skills in this suite check for its presence at startup; when present, they
auto-load it instead of re-asking the professor for context.

## Iron rules

1. **Append, don't overwrite.** A skill updating the passport adds or amends its own
   stage's fields; it never deletes another stage's entries. Corrections are made by the
   professor at a checkpoint, not silently by an agent.
2. **No invented context.** If a field a skill needs is empty (e.g., `learner_profile`),
   the skill asks the professor — it does not fabricate plausible values. Unknown is a
   legitimate value; a guess recorded as fact is not.
3. **Outcomes are the spine.** Every assessment lists `outcomes_assessed`; every schedule
   week lists `outcomes`. An artifact that maps to no outcome is flagged at the Alignment
   Gate, not quietly accepted.
4. **Checkpoint provenance.** `confirmed_by_professor` is set only when the professor has
   actually confirmed at a checkpoint. Agents never set it preemptively.
5. **Graceful absence.** All skills work standalone without a passport — they simply ask
   for the context they need and offer to create a passport at the end.
